       "The issue you're encountering is related to GitHub permissions. Let's break down the error message and provide you with a step-by-step approach to resolving it.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Error Breakdown:\n",
       "- **\"remote: Permission to renzvalentino/llm_engineering.git denied to samesquejo.\"**\n",
       "  - This indicates that the user `samesquejo` does not have the necessary permissions to push to the repository `renzvalentino/llm_engineering.git`.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **\"fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/renzvalentino/llm_engineering.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403\"**\n",
       "  - The `403` HTTP status code means \"Forbidden\", which confirms that your authentication to access the repository is failing due to permission issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Steps to Resolve the Issue:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Check Your Role:**\n",
       "   - First, confirm whether you are a contributor to the repository. Only users with specific roles (like Admin, Write, or Maintainer) can push changes. If you are only a Read-Only collaborator or not listed as a collaborator at all, you will need to request access from the repo owner.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Check Authentication Method:**\n",
       "   - If you are using HTTPS for pushing, ensure you have the correct credentials set up. You may need to configure your personal access token if your account security settings have changed. GitHub no longer supports password-based authentication for HTTPS. You can generate a personal access token by:\n",
       "     - Going to GitHub and logging in.\n",
       "     - Navigate to **Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens**.\n",
       "     - Click on “Generate new token” and grant it appropriate scopes (like repo access).\n",
       "     - Use this token in place of your password when prompted by Git.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Caching / Credential Helper:**\n",
       "   - If you previously authenticated with incorrect credentials, Git may be caching those. To clear cached credentials, you can use:\n",
       "     bash\n",
       "     git credential-cache exit\n",
       "     \n",
       "   - Alternatively, you can find the stored credentials on your OS.\n",
       "     - On Windows: Credential Manager.\n",
       "     - On macOS: Keychain Access.\n",
       "     - On Linux: Check `~/.git-credentials`.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Verify the Remote URL:**\n",
       "   - Double-check the remote repository URL you are trying to push to. You can verify by running:\n",
       "     bash\n",
       "     git remote -v\n",
       "     \n",
       "   - Make sure that the URL matches exactly the repository you intend to push to. If it doesn't, you can update it using:\n",
       "     bash\n",
       "     git remote set-url origin https://github.com/renzvalentino/llm_engineering.git\n",
       "     \n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Check Repository Settings:**\n",
       "   - If you're the owner or a collaborator, ensure that the repository settings allow for your user access and check branch protection rules that might restrict access to certain branches.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Log Out and Log Back In:**\n",
       "   - Sometimes refreshing your authentication state can help. Log out from GitHub and reauthorize.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion:\n",
       "If you've verified all these steps and still face issues, reach out to the repository owner to ensure that you have correct permissions or to see if there are any additional guidelines they wish you to follow. Once the permission checks are cleared and your credentials are properly established, you should be able to push to the repository without encountering the error."

       "\n",
       "The error message indicates that GitHub has denied your request due to permission issues. This is usually caused by one of two reasons:\n",

       "1. **Repository permissions**: The owner of the repository (`renzvalentino`) might have restricted access controls, denying you permission to clone the repository.\n",
       "2. **API rate limiting or blocking**: Your account's API credentials may have been flagged for excessive requests, causing GitHub to block your attempts to access certain repositories.\n",
